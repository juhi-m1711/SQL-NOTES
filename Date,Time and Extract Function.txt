11. EXTRACT(unit FROM date) – Pulls a specific part (year/month/day) from a date.
12. DATEDIFF(date1, date2) – Returns the number of days between two dates.
13. DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL x unit) – Adds a time interval to a date.
14. DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL x unit) – Subtracts a time interval from a date.
15. LAST_DAY(date) – Returns the last day of the month for that date.
16. MAKEDATE(year, day_of_year) – Creates a date from year + day number.
17. STR_TO_DATE(string, format) – Converts a string into a date using a format.
18. DATE_FORMAT(date, format) – Formats a date into a custom string.

22. HOUR(time) – Extracts the hour (0–23) from a time value.
23. MINUTE(time) – Extracts the minute part.
24. SECOND(time) – Extracts the seconds part.
25. EXTRACT(unit FROM time) – Extracts hour, minute, or second from a time.
26. TIMEDIFF(time1, time2) – Returns the difference between two time values.
27. TIME_TO_SEC(time) – Converts time into total seconds.
28. SEC_TO_TIME(seconds) – Converts seconds back into HH:MM:SS format.
29. MAKETIME(hour, minute, second) – Creates a time value.
30. ADDTIME(time, interval) – Adds time to a time value.
31. SUBTIME(time, interval) – Subtracts time from a time value.
📌 DATETIME Functions (One-Line Explanations)
32. TIMESTAMP() – Returns the current timestamp.
